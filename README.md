# Equitable Building Decarbonization (EBD) – Address Eligibility Lookup Tool

This project provides a **web-based address lookup and eligibility verification tool** for the Equitable Building Decarbonization (EBD) program.

The tool validates user-provided addresses, determines their census tract and region, checks program eligibility, and displays **county-level income thresholds** by household size.  
It can be embedded directly into the EBD program website via a single `<script>` tag.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Address validation + geocoding**  
  → via [Smarty US Street API](https://www.smarty.com/products/us-street-api).

- **Spatial overlay**  
  → via ArcGIS REST service for census tract and region lookup.
  → See https://github.com/CenterForSustainableEnergy/geocodeidentify for additional details.

- **Program logic**
  - Maps **census tract → region + geographic eligibility** using local CSV (`tracts.csv`).
  - If outside the Central region → displays region + redirect link.
  - If inside Central but ineligible → shows email collection form for future updates.
  - If eligible → confirms geographic eligibility and directs to income eligibility table.

- **County income verification**  
  - Uses `county_income.csv` to show **maximum eligible income** for household sizes 1–8 by ZIP code.

- **Frontend**
  - Built using **Vite + TypeScript (vanilla template)**.
  - Exports an embeddable widget (`lookup-widget.min.js`).

- **Backend**
  - Built using **Hono + Bun**.
  - Handles API requests to Smarty, ArcGIS, and local CSV lookups.

- **Developer tooling**
  - **Biome** for linting/formatting.
  - **Husky** for pre-commit hooks (runs Biome automatically).
  - **Concurrently** for parallel dev mode.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Developers)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CenterForSustainableEnergy/ebd-addresseligibility-tool.git
cd ebd-addresseligibility-tool
```

### 2. To install dependencies:

Install bun (for windows). More details at https://bun.com/docs/installation.

```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

OR (if node is available)

```bash
npm install -g bun
```

These should be installed at the project root. 

```bash
bun install
bun add -d vite
```

### 3. Environmental Variables
Create a new .env file at repo root. Contact John Anderson for Smarty Key access. 

```ini
SMARTY_AUTH_ID=your-smarty-id
SMARTY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-smarty-token
PORT=3000
```
.env is ignored by Git — do not commit it.

### 4. Build the Widget

```bash
bun run build:widget
```
Output file:
frontend/dist/embed/lookup-widget.min.js

### 5. Run the Backend

```bash
bun run backend/src/index.ts
```
Backend starts on http://localhost:3000.

### 6. Test the Tool Locally

```bash
http://localhost:3000/test.html
```

You should see:

* Address, City, ZIP inputs

* Search button

* Results table (geographic eligibility)

* County income eligibility verification table

* Email capture form (for ineligible Central-region users)

## Deployment
### Initial installation
Assuming installation happens on an existing site served by IIS:
1. Build frontend with `bun run build:widget`
2. Copy frontend/dist/\* to desired location in the webserver root
3. Install ARR and URL Rewrite from the Microsooft IIS site, if needed: Under Application Request Routing → Server Proxy Settings, ensure Enable Proxy is checked.
4. Ensure ARR is setup to allow proxy traffic:  
- Open IIS Manager → your site → URL Rewrite → Add Rules → Reverse Proxy.
- Set proxy to: 
```txt
Requested URL: Matches the Pattern
Using: Regular Expressions
Pattern: ^api/(.*)
Action Type: Rewrite
Rewrite URL: http://localhost:3000/api/{R:1}
```
5. Ensure the proxy rule is the first one, and that it's set to stop processing rules after matching.
6. Run the backend as a schedueld task using Task Scheduler:
- Make a logs folder, e.g.,: `D:\ebd-addresseligibility-tool\logs\`
- Open Task Scheduler
- Action (right pane) → Create Task… (not “Basic Task”)
- General tab
	- Name: EBD Backend
	- Security options:
	- Select an account that has access to D:\ebd-addresseligibility-tool (yours is fine).
	- Run whether user is logged on or not ✅
	- Run with highest privileges ✅
	- Configure for: your Windows version.
- Triggers tab
	- New…
		- Begin the task: At startup
		- Delay task for: (optional) 30 seconds
		- Enabled ✅
	- (Optional) Add a second trigger: At log on → for “Any user”.
- Actions tab
- New…
	- Action: Start a program
	- Program/script: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
	- Add arguments: `/c ""C:\Users\John.Anderson\.bun\bin\bun.exe" run backend/src/index.ts >> "D:\ebd-addresseligibility-tool\logs\backend.out.log" 2>&1"`
	- Start in: D:\ebd-addresseligibility-tool
- Conditions tab
	- Uncheck Start the task only if the computer is on AC power (server scenarios often always on AC).
	- Uncheck Stop if the computer switches to battery.
- Settings tab
	- Allow task to be run on demand ✅
	- If the task fails, restart every: 1 minute, Attempt to restart up to: 3 times ✅
	- If the task is already running, then the following rule applies: Do not start a new instance ✅
	- Stop the task if it runs longer than: Uncheck (you want it to run indefinitely)
	- Click OK → you’ll be prompted for credentials → enter them.
7. If needed, add domains to allowed list in backend/src/index.ts
8. If needed, check CORS working by running the following on a different computer (not the webserver):  
```powershell
$h = @{
>>   "Origin" = "https://domain.to-test.org"
>>   "Access-Control-Request-Method" = "POST"
>> }
Invoke-WebRequest "https://maps3.energycenter.org/api/validate" -Method OPTIONS -Headers $h
```
9. Test working

### Modification procedure
If modifications are needed, you may need to force quite the currently running process. It doesn't always accept End commands from Task Scheduler.
1. Check to see if a previously started process is listening on port 3000: 
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```
2. Force quit the running process:
```powershell
Stop-Process -Id <PID_FROM_ABOVE> -Force
```
3. Make changes
4. Restart the service from the Task Scheduler GUI or with
```powershell
schtasks /Run /TN "EBD Address Tool backend"
```

## Embedding the Widget on a Website

Add this snippet to any webpage:

```html
<!-- EBD Lookup Tool -->
<script src="https://yourdomain.org/embed/lookup-widget.min.js"></script>
<div id="EBDLookupContainer"></div>
<script>
  EBDLookup.init("EBDLookupContainer");
</script>
```

The widget automatically:
* Renders the input form and results table.
* Calls your backend APIs for validation and overlay.
* Adopts your site’s CSS styling.


Developer Workflow

Lint/format check:

```bash
bun run biome check .
```

Auto-fix:

```bash
bun run biome check --write .
```

Git hooks: Husky runs Biome automatically before each commit.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.22. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
